## Client side

This is the client side of the application. Here you will find information about the client of the project. If you want to read information about the project itself you should go to the main directory and read the "readme".

### Tecnologies I employed

This client has been created using the react main libraries (react and react-dom) in combination with others( react-router-dom, react-redux, redux, redux-promise, redux-thunk, react-simple-sidenav and axios ).
